Cloudr is an unofficial client for CloudApp (http://www.getcloudapp.com).

Features:
- share images from a file manager or the Gallery
- share bookmarks
- navigate and browse your drops collection
- delete drops

The application is still in early development stages, so stay tuned because more features are on the way.

Cloudr is completely free of charge, as will future versions of Cloudr. 

Note that this application requires a (free) CloudApp account.
